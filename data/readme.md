## The LTNs Encoding of the Visual Relationship Dataset
[Here](https://scientificnet-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/idonadello_unibz_it/EsYkkN-kAoBGvCgxQ3UyoeQB8mgrhkWiyAn-CQr7EoEwAA?e=bKXp6N) you can find the LTNs encoding of the Visual Relationship Dataset. The dataset is already divided into the `train` and `test` folder and each folder contains the encoding for LTNs of the VRD images and their annotations. The `sg_test_images` folder contains the 1000 raw images of the VRD test set and the `ontology` folder contains the adopted logical constraints.
